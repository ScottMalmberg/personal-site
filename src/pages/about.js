        <p>
            My name is Scott. I was born and raised in Texas, but fell madly in love with nature when I moved to Utah. 
            I'm currently living in Spokane, Washington and have enjoyed exploring the beautiful Pacific Northwest.

            After spending the first four years of my career in the digital ads space, I started to realize I enjoyed the tech side of marketing more than anything else.
            I started diving into automation, using tools like Zapier and Infusionsoft to help streamline my client's business processes. I was hooked.

            From there, I got into web design. This started with WordPress themes and moved to using builders like Thrive Architect to customize pages/sites from scratch. 
            While learning what goes into making a good webpage, I started teaching myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through FreeCodeCamp.

            Honestly, I was caught off-guard by how much I enjoyed learning to code. The feeling of solving a problem after struggling with it for a while has become addicting. 
            So, I decided to keep learning. I'm currently teaching myself React and Redux and will move on to learning Node.js after that.

            Besides programming, I try to spend as much time as I can outside hiking, camping, and exploring with my wife and our two dogs. 
            I've played guitar since I was 9 years old, and have since picked up a variety of other instruments. 
            I also love to cook, bake, and eat. My dream is to live on a solar-powered farm growing fresh fruit and vegetables.
